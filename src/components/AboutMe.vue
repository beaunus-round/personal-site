                That usually means automation, clean CRM logic, better leadflow, fewer moving parts. I like building things that scale without becoming unmanageable. If something's manual and shouldn't be, I'll probably fix it. If the output's messy, I'll usually clean it up.

                Most of my work lives at the edge of marketing and operations. I've led projects across real estate, lending, B2B, and a lot of in-betweenâ€”streamlining outreach, syncing backend tools, wiring up the logic behind campaigns that actually convert. It's not just about getting more done. It's about knowing why it's working and how to keep it that way.
