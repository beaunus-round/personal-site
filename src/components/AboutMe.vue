                That usually means automation, clean CRM logic, better leadflow, fewer moving parts. I like building things that scale without becoming unmanageable. If something's manual and shouldn't be, I'll probably fix it. If the output's messy, I'll usually clean it up.

                I like being the one who makes things actually function. Not the loudest voice in the room, but the one who connects the dots. If it touches data, automation, or flow, I probably have thoughts on how to make it better.

                Most of my work lives at the edge of marketing and operations. I've led projects across real estate, lending, B2B, and a lot of in-betweenâ€”streamlining outreach, syncing backend tools, wiring up the logic behind campaigns that actually convert. It's not just about getting more done. It's about knowing why it's working and how to keep it that way.

                Data lives at the heart of everything that I do, because without having clear indications of what working and what isn't based on real, actionable figures, it's impossible to scale efficiently and with confidence. That means creating Vercel dashbaords, making use of bleeding-edge analytics tools, and creating thoughtful OKRs at the beginning of each project or campaign.
